Terrain \u00b6 10.1 General \u00b6 A terrain hex is defined by the terrain features in the hex. A hex may contain small, aesthetic features that do not affect or define the terrain type of the hex (i.e. a small tree does not constitute a woods hex). Terrain features affect movement by adjusting the Movement Points a unit must expend to enter the hex, and combat is affected by applying the cover modifier of the target hex to the attacker's dice roll. 10.2 Open Ground \u00b6 A unit must expend one Movement Point to enter an open ground hex. An open ground hex does not block LOS, and has no effect on combat. Beach, river banks and desert hexes are considered open ground if they contain no terrain feature that affects LOS or combat. 10.3 Road \u00b6 A unit must expend one Movement Point to enter a road hex. A road hex does not block LOS, and has no effect on combat. 10.31 Bridge \u00b6 A bridge hex is considered a road hex for movement purposes. A unit must expend one Movement Point to enter a bridge hex. Vehicles and Guns (whether towed or being moved by their crews) may only enter a bridge hex from a connecting road hex. Bridge hexes over streams and canals negate the movement effects of the stream or canal; units may move freely over a stream or canal when crossing through a bridge hex. Units in a bridge hex are considered to be on the bridge, not occupying the terrain under the bridge. Bridge hexes do not block LOS, and provide no cover modifier to units occupying the hex. 10.4 Building \u00b6 A unit must expend two Movement Points to enter a building hex. Vehicles are prohibited from entering a building hex, except when indicated by special scenario rule. Large Guns (i.e. Movement Points of 0) are prohibited from occupying building hexes, except when indicated by special scenario rule. Building hexes block LOS, and provide a +3 cover modifier to units occupying the hex. 10.5 Woods and Jungle \u00b6 A unit must expend two Movement Points to enter a woods or jungle hex. Woods and jungle hexes block LOS, and provide a +2 cover modifier to units occupying the hex. 10.6 Stream, Gully and Wadi \u00b6 An infantry unit must expend two Movement Points to enter a stream, gully or wadi hex. Vehicles must expend three Movement Points. Stream, gully and wadi hexes do not block LOS and provide a +1 cover modifier to units occupying the hex. 10.7 Hill (Level 1 and Level 2) \u00b6 A hill hex represents terrain with a higher elevation than surrounding, \"ground level\" terrain. A Level 1 hill hex is brown, and a Level 2 hill hex is dark brown. A hill hex may also contain other types of terrain (e.g. woods). A unit that enters a hill hex (i.e. moves from a ground level hex to a Level 1 hill hex, or from a Level 1 hill hex to a Level 2 hill hex) must expend one extra Movement Point, in addition to the normal cost of the terrain in the hex. For instance, if a hill hex is open terrain, a unit entering it from a ground level hex must expend two Movement Points - one for entering an open hex, and one additional Movement Point for moving uphill. A unit moving downhill (i.e. from a Level 1 hill hex to a ground level hex), or along a series of hill hexes at the same level, pays only the normal movement costs for the terrain in the hex. A vehicle or gun may not move from a ground level hex to a Level 2 hill hex, or vice versa. Infantry units must expend their full movement allowance to move from a ground level hex to a Level 2 hill hex, or vice versa, and may not use the Infantry Assault Movement bonus (see 6.4 ). Hill hexes block LOS except in cases where only one Level 1 hill hex is crossed-the first, \"slope\" hex-leading either up to a Level 2 hill hex, or down to any ground level hex from a Level 2 hill hex (see the LOS Examples ). A unit on a string of adjacent, same level hill hexes (a plateau) has LOS to units on the hill plateau, or on a separate hill of the same elevation, unless there is other intervening terrain between them that blocks LOS. 10.8 Orchards, Hay Stacks and Palm Groves \u00b6 A unit entering an orchard, hay stack, or palm grove hex must expend one Movement Point. Orchard, hay stack, and palm grove hexes do not block LOS, but are a hindrance and modify all attack rolls tracing their LOS into or through the hex by +1. 10.9 Farmland \u00b6 There are two types of farmland: fields and crops. A scenario will state if a farmland hex is a field or crop. If not specified, the hex is a field. A unit entering a farmland hex (field or crop) must expend one Movement Point. Fields are open terrain (i.e. no effect on movement or combat), and crops are farmland in season. Crop hexes do not block LOS, but are a hindrance and modify all attack rolls that trace their LOS into or through the hex by +1. 10.10 Walls and Hedges \u00b6 Walls and hedges are hexside terrain features. A unit crossing a wall or hedge hexside must expend one Movement Point to cross the hexside in addition to the cost of the terrain in the hex it is entering. Walls and hedges do not block LOS, but are a hindrance and modify attack rolls which trace their LOS across or along the hexside by +1, in addition to any other hex cover or hexside LOS modifiers that may apply. Units adjacent to a wall or hedge hexside ignore the hindrance effects when firing across a wall or hedge; they are considered to be firing over the wall or through the hedge. Units firing along a wall or hedge hexside always apply the hindrance modifier, even if the firing unit(s) are adjacent to the hexside in question. 10.101 Hedgerows (Bocage) \u00b6 A special scenario rule may indicate that hedges are hedgerows, or bocage, terrain specific to the countryside of Normandy. Hedgerows block LOS (i.e. units may see into a hedgerow hex, but not beyond), but otherwise affect movement and combat the same as hedges. 10.11 Canal, Pond and Marsh \u00b6 All units are prohibited from entering a canal, pond, or marsh hex. Units may only cross a canal through a bridge hex. Canal, pond, and marsh hexes do not block LOS, and have no effect on combat. 10.12 Ocean, River and Beach \u00b6 Ocean and river hexes are completely water covered, and therefore contain no terrain feature other than water. Ocean and river hexes that also contain a land depiction are considered beach (or river bank, in the case of river) hexes with passable, shallow water. Ocean and river hexes (full or half hexes) are impassable to all units, whereas beach and river bank hexes are considered open terrain (for movement and combat purposes). Ocean and river hexes have no effect on LOS or combat. Terrain Hexes and Effects \u00b6","title":"10. Terrain"},{"location":"10_terrain/#10-terrain","text":"","title":"10.

Support Weapons \u00b6 12.1 General \u00b6 There are three types of support weapons: Light ( L ), Heavy ( H ), and Expendable ( X ). The support weapon's type is indicated on the counter. Light ( L ) support weapons include light machine guns, anti-tank weapons (e.g. bazookas, Panzerschrecks), and flamethrowers. Heavy ( H ) support weapons include medium machine guns, heavy machine guns, and light mortars. Expendable ( X ) support weapons include Panzerfausts, grenades, and satchel charges. 12.2 Portage \u00b6 Unit Carries Movement Squad Light/Heavy Heavy -1 MP Half squad Light/Heavy Heavy -1 MP Leader Light (normal) A squad or half squad may carry one support weapon. A leader may carry one Light ( L ) support weapon. A support weapon counter is placed under the unit carrying it (Exception: Expendable ( X ) support weapons are not placed with, or attached to, a specific unit). If a unit carrying a support weapon is eliminated the weapon is also eliminated. Support weapons do not count towards stacking limits. A unit moves normally when carrying a Light ( L ) support weapon. A squad or half squad carrying a Heavy ( H ) support weapon reduces its Movement Points by one (-1) . 12.3 Support Weapon Usage \u00b6 Unit Light Heavy Squad Unit + Weapon APFP Unit + Weapon APFP Half squad Unit + Weapon APFP Weapon APFP only Leader Weapon APFP only - A unit may fire one support weapon per turn. If the support weapon can be used for either an AP or AT attack, the firing player must declare which type of attack the unit is conducting. A squad may add the APFP of a Light ( L ) or Heavy ( H ) support weapon to its inherent APFP. A half squad may add the APFP of a Light ( L ) support weapon to its inherent APFP. When a leader fires a Light ( L ) support weapon, or a half squad fires a Heavy ( H ) support weapon, only the APFP of the weapon is used . If the target is outside of the attacking unit's range, but within the support weapon's range, only the APFP of the support weapon is used. If a unit uses a mortar to make an indirect fire attack, only the mortar's APFP is used. 12.4 Exchange or Transfer \u00b6 Infantry units occupying the same hex may exchange or transfer support weapons during the owning player's Command Phase. The support weapons are simply moved to the new unit, as long as the unit's normal portage capacity is not exceeded by the weapon. 12.5 Expendable ( X ) Support Weapons \u00b6 Expendable ( X ) support weapons are single-use weapons, and as such their counters are removed from play after use. Expendable ( X ) support weapons include Panzerfausts, grenades, and satchel charges. Expendable support weapons are not carried by specific units. When a scenario's OOB indicates a side is equipped with Panzerfausts, grenades, or satchel charges, the number of appropriate support weapon counters are placed in front of, and remain with, the owning player until he wishes to use them by any of his eligible units. 12.51 Panzerfausts and Anti-Tank Grenades \u00b6 Panzerfausts and Anti-Tank Grenades are man-portable, hollow charge anti-tank weapons. A Panzerfaust or AT Grenade may only be used to conduct an AT attack versus an eligible target in an adjacent hex (i.e. an AFV, vehicle, or Gun). Panzerfausts and AT Grenades have no effect on infantry units. After use, the Panzerfaust or AT Grenade counter is removed from play. 12.52 Grenades \u00b6 Grenades are small, anti-personnel explosive devices carried by infantry units. Grenades may only be used against targets in an adjacent hex, and only one Grenades counter may be used per unit, per attack. Grenades may not be used for AT attacks. When a Grenade counter is used by an attacking unit the attack dice roll is modified by -1. When used by a defending unit during a close assault, the assaulter's Kill Number is modified by -1 (i.e. a Kill Number of 6 becomes a 5). A unit may fire a support weapon when using grenades (in addition to its inherent APFP). Grenades may be used by passengers on an AFV conducting an overrun attack (see 19. Armor Overruns ), against the targets of the overrun. A Grenades counter is removed from play after it is used. 12.53 Satchel Charges \u00b6 Satchel charges are canvas bags filled with explosives. A satchel charge may only be used against targets in an adjacent hex. Satchel charges may not be used for AT attacks. A unit using a satchel charge adds the satchel charge's APFP to its own. A unit may not fire a support weapon when it uses a satchel charge, and it may only use one satchel charge per attack. Satchel charges may be used in a close assault, by either side, to increase their APFP total. A satchel charge may also be used by passengers on an AFV conducting an overrun attack, against the units targeted by the overrun. A Satchel Charge counter is removed from play after it is used. 12.6 Mortars \u00b6 Mortars are indirect fire weapons that provide on-board artillery support. Mortars are the only on-board weapons that may use indirect fire. Medium and heavy mortars are not represented on the board; they are represented by off- board artillery support. 12.61 Firing Restrictions \u00b6 Due to the nature of how a mortar fires, mortars may never form fire groups with infantry units, and an infantry unit firing a mortar may never add its inherent firepower to the mortars APFP. However, mortars located in the same hex must combine their APFP ratings into a single barrage when attacking the same target. A leader occupying the same hex may add his leadership modifier to a mortar attack. Mortars may not make Opportunity Fire attacks. Mortars may not fire from building hexes or bunkers. 12.62 LOS and Indirect Fire \u00b6 If a unit firing a mortar has LOS to its target no spotter is necessary. If a unit firing a mortar cannot see its target, an unpinned, friendly unit must act as a spotter and have LOS to the target hex. If neither the unit with the mortar nor an unpinned, friendly unit have LOS to the target hex, the mortar cannot attack that hex. 12.63 Terrain Modifiers \u00b6 Terrain or hindrances between a mortar and its target have no effect on a mortar attack, including any hexside terrain features around the target hex. Only the terrain within the target hex itself modifies a mortar attack. 12.64 Air Bursts Versus Infantry \u00b6 Casualty Points from a mortar attack to infantry units in woods and jungle hexes are doubled . 12.65 Minimum Range \u00b6 Mortars have a minimum range of two hexes (indicated on the counter by an exponent of 2 next to the weapons range), and may not fire at targets inside the minimum range. 12.66 Smoke Rounds \u00b6 A mortar may fire a smoke round in lieu of an attack, and the same rules apply to firing a smoke round as firing normally (i.e. the unit must have LOS to the target hex, or a spotter with LOS to the target hex). The mortar automatically places a Smoke 2 marker in the target hex; no dice roll is necessary. The unit is marked with a Fire marker, and two smoke factors are deducted from the player's smoke supply. 12.67 Mortar Fire Versus Vehicles \u00b6 When a mortar strikes a hex containing one or more vehicles, there is a chance it may hit and destroy the units. A dice roll of 6 or less results in a hit versus a vehicle; roll separately for each vehicle. Cover modifiers of the target hex apply to the to-hit roll. A hit versus an unarmored vehicle automatically destroys the unit. A hit versus an AFV is resolved by cross-indexing the mortar's AT rating with the unit's rear armor rating on the Armor Elimination Table to obtain an Elimination Number. An additional dice roll equal to or less than the Elimination Number destroys the target.","title":"12. Support Weapons"},{"location":"12_support_weapons/#12-support-weapons","text":"","title":"12.

Basic Combat Principles \u00b6 13.1 General \u00b6 Units conduct attacks using either their Anti-Personnel Firepower (APFP) or Anti-Tank Firepower (ATFP) ratings, whichever is appropriate. Each unit may only attack once per turn (Exception: Close Assaults , and Final Opportunity Fire versus an overrunning AFV). 13.2 Direct and Indirect Fire \u00b6 For simplicity's sake, V&V considers all combat on the board to be direct fire, with the exception of on-board mortars (see 12.6 Mortars ). Even artillery Guns, which are typically known as indirect fire weapons, are used as direct fire weapons. They are simply being used in an improvised capacity, with the crew firing over open sights at targets within their LOS. 13.3 Range and LOS \u00b6 A unit may fire on a target to which it has range and LOS. The range is the number of hexes from the firing unit to the target unit, counting the target unit(s) hex, but not the firing unit(s). A Gun has no range limit, and may target a unit anywhere on the board as long as the unit has an unblocked LOS to the target. 13.4 Cover Modifiers \u00b6 The cover (terrain) modifier of the target hex is added to the attacker's dice roll. Units in a fortification or entrenchment (see 20. Fortifications and Entrenchments ) add the position's cover modifier to the attack dice roll. Hex and hexsides between the attacking unit(s) and the target hex that contain hindrances will further modify the attack dice roll, and hindrance modifiers are cumulative. 13.5 Gun Shields \u00b6 A Gun Shield provides extra protection to the inherent crew of the Gun, but only when attacked from within the Gun's FFA, and only when the Gun is not moving. Guns with a Gun Shield may ignore the first Casualty Point from AP fire, and when attacked by AT fire the Gun Shield provides a +1 cover modifier. A Gun Shield's protection against AT attacks is cumulative with the cover modifier of the hex or fortification the unit occupies. 13.6 Leadership Modifiers \u00b6 A leader in the same hex with an attacking infantry unit or fire group may modify the attack dice roll (AP or AT) with his Leadership Modifier. A leader may modify his attack when firing alone. Only one Leadership Modifier may be applied to an attack roll, and a leader may only modify one attack per turn (Exception: Close Assaults , and Final Opportunity Fire versus an overrunning AFV). A leader that modifies an attack is marked as fired, whether or not he uses his APFP in the attack. 13.7 LOS and Firing Through Occupied Hexes \u00b6 Units have no effect on LOS or combat. Units may trace LOS and fire through hexes occupied by other units, friendly or enemy, with no detriment. 13.8 Opportunity Fire \u00b6 Opportunity Fire is a form of defensive fire a player may use during the opposing player's Movement Phase. When a unit moves (i.e. enters a new hex), any enemy unit that has LOS to that unit, and not marked with a Fire marker, may conduct an Opportunity Fire attack versus the unit. The player conducting the Opportunity Fire attack may stop the target unit at any point during the move, but only after the unit enters a new hex. If entering a hex will take the unit out of LOS the Opportunity Fire attack cannot be made. If the moving unit enters a hex containing other, non-moving friendly units, only the moving unit may be targeted, or affected by, the Opportunity Fire attack. If a unit is pinned or immobilized (AFVs only) while moving through a friendly hex already stacked to its limit the unit is eliminated (for its full Casualty Point value, if applicable). Any targeted unit still eligible to move (i.e. not pinned), including units moving as a stack, may continue to do so after the Opportunity Fire attack is resolved. Target hex APFP dice roll modifier No positive cover modifier -1 Adjacent hex -2 APFP Opportunity Fire attacks versus units where no positive cover modifier applies (terrain, Assault Movement, etc.) receive a -1 dice roll modifier, and a -2 modifier applies versus units in an adjacent hex, regardless of (and in addition to) applicable terrain effects. Units that conduct an Opportunity Fire attack are marked with a Fire marker. 13.9 MG Fire Lanes \u00b6 A player may establish a fire lane whenever an infantry unit with an MG makes an Opportunity Fire attack. Fire lanes are voluntary; a player is not required to create a fire lane. Fire lanes are not established with any other AP fire combat; only infantry Opportunity Fire attacks with an MG may create a fire lane. AFV and vehicle MGs cannot create fire lanes. The fire lane extends from the firing hex to the target hex. A Fire Lane marker is placed in each hex along the original LOS, including the target hex, but not the firing unit's hex. The number of Fire Lane markers used is equal to the original range to the target (i.e. if the range was four hexes, four Fire Lane markers are placed). The fire lane should maintain a consistent pattern, if possible, with each Fire Lane marker placed one after another in adjacent hexes, or adjacent alternating hexes. Infantry, Gun, or unarmored vehicle units that enter a fire lane hex are immediately attacked using the 1-4 row of the AP Combat Table. No combat or cover modifiers apply, as units are considered to be entering an established fire lane (Exception: See 13.91 Fire Lane Crossfire , below). Units already occupying a fire lane when it is established are not affected; a unit is only affected when entering a fire lane hex. Fire Lane markers are removed at the end of the current Move Phase. 13.91 Fire Lane Crossfire \u00b6 Multiple Fire Lane markers may be placed in a hex, if Opportunity Fire attacks from multiple machine guns affect the same hexes. One Fire Lane marker per attacking machine gun is placed in a crossfire hex. If multiple machine guns from the same hex fire along the same path, each hex in the fire lane would receive multiple Fire Lane markers, one per machine gun. Each additional Fire Lane marker in a hex, after the first, subtracts -1 from the fire lane's attack. For instance, if two machine guns conduct an Opportunity Fire attack and their fire lanes cross, causing two Fire Lane markers to be placed in the crossfire hex, that hex would attack on the 1-4 row of the AP Combat Table and receive a -1 modifier . Fire Lane Examples \u00b6 The examples at left detail some of the options available when creating a fire lane. A fire lane extends from the hex of origin, in this case from the hexes containing American units firing their light machine guns, out to the target hexes. Use the LOS from the hex of origin to the target hex to determine the fire lane's pattern. Fire lanes must maintain a consistent pattern, either in a straight line along the LOS (as shown from hex A5 to hex E3), or equally staggered on alternating sides of the LOS. When staggering, the fire lane must maintain the same pattern along its entire length, with Fire Lane markers alternately falling on each side of the line, as determined by the player creating the fire lane. Note: Each machine gun may only create a single fire lane. The two fire lanes originating from hex A5 are simply detailing fire lane possibilities. 13.10 Squad and Half Squad Consistency \u00b6 When squads are reduced to half squads, or voluntarily split into two half squads, the half squads must be of the same type as the original squad (i.e. a German Rifle squad would be reduced to a German Rifle half squad, or split into two Rifle half squads). The same rule applies when two half squads are combined to form a full squad; the two half squads must be of the same type as the full squad. A player may only begin a game with half squads if indicated by a scenario's OOB.","title":"13.

Anti-Personnel (AP) Combat \u00b6 14.1 Anti-Personnel Fire \u00b6 Anti-personnel (AP) fire may be used against infantry units, unarmored vehicles, and Guns. AP fire is considered an area fire attack, and may affect any or all eligible units in the target hex. AP fire has no effect on AFVs. 14.2 Anti-Personnel Fire Groups \u00b6 Infantry units occupying the same hex may form a fire group, combining their APFP ratings to fire at the same target, or they may fire separately (or in smaller fire groups) at different targets. Infantry units in the same hex may not fire separately at the same target; if the units are attacking the same target, during the same turn, they must form a single fire group and combine their APFP ratings. A leader may use his Leadership Modifier to modify a fire group's attack, in addition to adding his APFP rating. Fire groups may conduct Opportunity Fire attacks. 14.3 Passengers on Transport Vehicles \u00b6 Infantry units being transported may conduct AP fire attacks. Light (L) machine guns, grenades, and satchel charges are the only support weapons passengers may use. Passengers may not join or form a fire group with infantry units outside of the transport vehicle, but they may form a fire group with other units in the vehicle, or with the transport vehicle. If the passenger unit(s) and transport are attacking the same target they must form a fire group and combine their APFP ratings into one attack. 14.4 AFV, Vehicle, and Gun AP Fire Guidelines \u00b6 AFVs, vehicles, and Guns may never form fire groups; they must resolve their AP attacks separately (Exception: Passengers may form a fire group with their transport vehicle). Type Range Gun APFP Unlimited MG APFP 8 AFVs and vehicles may be armed with multiple AP weapons, indicated by multiple APFP ratings on the unit's counter. A Gun has only one APFP rating, listed under its ATFP rating. If an AFV or vehicle is equipped with more than one AP weapon - Gun, FF MG, or 360\u00b0 MG, or any combination of the three - the unit may combine the APFP ratings into a single attack against one target. Regardless of the number of different weapons the unit may have, it may only conduct one attack per turn. Gun APFP may be fired at an unlimited range. MG APFP has a maximum range of eight hexes. A unit with a white circle beneath its Gun APFP is a turreted unit, and may fire its Gun in any direction. Otherwise, a unit's Gun APFP may only be fired at a target in the unit's FFA. A 360\u00b0 MG, noted by the white circle beneath the MG's APFP rating, may fire at a target in any direction within eight hexes. A FF MG may only fire at a target in the unit's FFA within eight hexes. Example The M4A3E8 is equipped with its main Gun (with an APFP of 12), a 360\u00b0 MG (with an APFP of 4), and a FF MG (with an APFP of 3). The M4A3E8 is turreted (noted by the white circle under the ATFP), so the Gun may be fired in any direction, at unlimited range, with an APFP of 12. Or it may fire its Gun with the 360\u00b0 MG (noted by the white circle under the MG's rating) in any direction, to a range of eight hexes, with an APFP of 16. Or it may fire all three in its FFA, to a range of eight hexes, with an APFP of 19. 14.5 AP Fire Procedure \u00b6 The attacking player declares which units are conducting an AP fire attack, the target hex of the attack, and totals the APFP ratings of the attacking units. The attacking player makes a dice roll and applies any cover and leadership modifiers to the roll, and cross-references the final dice result with the APFP total on the Anti-Personnel Combat Table . 14.6 Combat Results \u00b6 Each attack will yield one of two results on the AP Combat Table: a dash (-) , indicating the attack had no effect, or Casualty Points (a # result) , indicating units in the target hex have suffered casualties or damage. 14.61 Applying Casualty Points \u00b6 Action CPs applied Notes Pin unit 1 Unit may not be eliminated after pinning Reduce squad to half squad Difference in Casulaty Rating May be pinned for 1 additional CP Eliminate unit Casualty Rating The defending player determines how Casualty Points are applied to the units in the target hex. He may choose to pin a unit for one Casualty Point, reduce a squad to a half squad for a number of Casualty Points equal to the reduction in Casualty Rating (i.e. a 4-6-4 Rifle squad reduced to a 2-6-2 Rifle half squad would fulfill two Casualty Points), or eliminate a unit for a number of Casualty Points equal to the unit's Casualty Rating. A squad that is reduced to a half squad may also be pinned for one additional Casualty Point. A unit may never be pinned and then eliminated; it must either be pinned, reduced (and then pinned, if desired), or eliminated. The defending player must fulfill all Casualty Points inflicted (i.e. the defending player must pin units, reduce squads to half squads, or eliminate units until all of the Casualty Points have been equalled or exceeded ). If pinning units in the target hex will not fulfill the Casualty Point total, units must be reduced or eliminated before pinning occurs. 14.62 Casualties Points and Pinned Units \u00b6 Casualty Points must be applied to unpinned units in a target hex before being applied to pinned units. If there are no unpinned units left the owning player has no option but to eliminate units. Pinned units may not be reduced, and are eliminated at their normal Casualty Rating. 14.63 Gun Shields and Valorous Units \u00b6 Guns with a Gun Shield and valorous infantry units (see 16. Infantry Valor ) may ignore the first Casualty Point inflicted against them. A Gun Shield only ignores the first Casualty Point if the attack occurs from within the Gun's FFA. After the first Casualty Point is ignored, if any additional Casualty Points remain, they must be applied to the same unit- either to pin, reduce, or eliminate the unit-before being applied to any other unit in the target hex. 14.64 Unarmored Vehicle and Gun Survival Roll \u00b6 Unarmored vehicles and Guns may be pinned by one Casualty Point, but if multiple Casualty Points are applied - up to the unit's maximum Casualty Rating - the unit must make a survival die roll. If the die roll is equal to or less than the Casualty Rating of the unit it is pinned, with the unit effectively \"absorbing\" all of the Casualty Points applied. If the die roll is greater than the Casualty Rating, the unit is eliminated. Any single attack against a vehicle or Gun that inflicts Casualty Points greater than the unit's Casualty Rating automatically eliminates the unit, no survival roll necessary. Passengers suffer the same fate as their transport vehicle, and if Passengers are eliminated their Casualty Rating is added to the total fulfilled. Pinned vehicles or Guns that receive Casualty Points may not make a survival roll, and are instead eliminated at their normal Casualty Rating. 14.65 Collateral Damage to Passengers \u00b6 Infantry units being transported by unarmored vehicles may be reduced or eliminated to fulfill Casualty Points, before applying any damage to the transporting vehicle or other units in the hex. Passengers on an AFV may not be used for collateral damage, since AP attacks have no effect on AFVs. Passengers may not be pinned to fulfill Casualty Points; they may only be reduced or eliminated. A Gun being transported may not be used as collateral damage. 14.7 Pinned Units \u00b6 When a unit is pinned it is flipped upside down. A pinned unit is unable to perform any actions, nor may it act as a spotter. If the pinned unit is a vehicle any passengers are also pinned. A unit remains pinned unless it successfully rallies during the After-Action Phase (see 14.8 , below), or until the owning player's next Command Phase when it automatically rallies and is flipped to its face-up side. 14.8 After-Action Phase Rally Attempt \u00b6 Unit Dice roll Leader \u2264 7 Infantry (elite) \u2264 7 Infantry \u2264 6 Vehicle \u2264 7 Gun \u2264 7 The active player, during his After-Action Phase, may attempt to rally his pinned units. Leaders, elite infantry units, vehicles and Guns rally on a dice roll of 7 or less . Regular infantry units rally on a dice roll of 6 or less . An unpinned leader may add his leadership modifier to the rally attempt of pinned unit(s) occupying the same hex. If a vehicle carrying passengers successfully rallies the passengers also rally. AP Combat and Casualty Reduction Example \u00b6 The German units in hex A1 (stack 1), are firing on the American units (stack A) in building hex B3. LOS is clear, and the range is two hexes- well within firing range. Since the German units are adjacent to the hedge they may fire over it with no penalty. The APFP is 12 (4 for each squad, 3 for the MG, plus 1 for the leader). The German player rolls two dice that yields a result of 5, modified by -1 for the leader (Hermes), and the building in hex B3 adds a +3 cover modifier, for a total modified attack dice roll of 7 (5-1+3=7). An APFP of 12 cross-indexed with an attack dice roll of 7 on the 11-18 row of the AP Combat Table yields a Casualty Point result of 2. The American player decides to reduce the squad not carrying the MG to a half squad for two points. Since the Americans still have a lot of firepower, and no pinned units, the German player decides not to move his second stack of units (stack 2), and opts to fire on the Americans again. The APFP total for stack 2 is 13. The German player rolls a 4, subtracts -1 for the leader (Schmidt), and adds the +3 cover modifier for the building for a final result of 6. A dice roll of 6 on the 11-18 row of the AP Combat Table yields 3 Casualty Points. The American player has a tough decision to make, and he chooses to reduce the full squad to a half squad for two Casualty Points, and pins the other half squad for a total of three, leaving a half squad with the MG able to perform an action. The American player decides to return fire, during the Defensive Fire Phase. His best target is stack 1, the German units behind the hedge. He attacks with an APFP total of 6 (2 for the half squad, 3 for the LMG, and 1 for the leader). He rolls an 8, subtracts -1 for the leader (Coleman), and adds +1 for the hedge's hindrance modifier for a total of 8. Cross-indexing a result of 8 on the 5-10 row of the AP Combat Table yields a result of no effect (-).","title":"14.

Close Assaults \u00b6 15.1 General \u00b6 Close assaults may be conducted by infantry units against an adjacent, enemy occupied hex. Close assaults occur during the Advance and Assault Phase, and may only be performed by infantry units that did not advance. A unit may conduct a close assault even if marked with a Move or Fire marker. Close assaults may be conducted against any type of unit. A close assault affects all units in the target hex, and all units in the target hex defend against the assault. Only infantry units from the same hex may close assault together; they may not combine with infantry units from separate hexes. A player does not have to assault with all of his units; he may assault with as many, or as few, as he feels necessary, but only one close assault may be conducted from a hex each turn. Any number of close assaults may be conducted against the same hex during the same turn, but each close assault must be resolved separately, and from a separate assault group. 15.2 Support Weapon Restrictions \u00b6 Assaulting units may only use Light (L) machine guns, grenades, and satchel charges. Defending infantry units may use any support weapon, within normal support weapon or close assault restrictions. 15.3 Close Assault Leadership Modifiers \u00b6 The assaulting player may subtract a leader's Leadership Modifier from his assault dice roll, even if the leader was used to modify an attack earlier in the same turn. The defending player may subtract a Leadership Modifier from the Kill Number before the assault is resolved, even if the leader was used to modify an attack earlier in the same turn. Each side may only use one Leadership Modifier per close assault resolution. 15.4 Defending AFV, Vehicle and Passenger Restrictions \u00b6 A defending AFV or vehicle may only use APFP from machine guns; the APFP of a main Gun may not be used when defending a close assault. An AFV or vehicle carrying passengers always adds the infantry unit(s) APFP rating(s) to its total, including any Light (L) machine guns, grenades, and satchel charges the player wishes to use. 15.5 Defending Gun and Unarmed Vehicle APFP Ratings \u00b6 Guns and unarmed vehicles (i.e. vehicles without machine guns) have an APFP of 2 when defending against a close assault. A Gun being transported may never contribute to a defending group's APFP total. 15.6 Close Assault Procedure \u00b6 The assaulting player declares which units are conducting a close assault, and the target hex of the assault. The assaulting player totals the APFP ratings of the assaulting units, and compares it to the APFP total for the defending unit(s) to obtain an odds ratio. All fractions are rounded down. For example, if the attacking player's APFP rating is 14 to the defender's 6, the odds are two to one (2-1). If the odds were reversed, with an attacking APFP of 6 versus the defender's 14, the ratio would be one to two (1-2). The assaulting player consults the Close Assault Table , and the number listed below the odds ratio is the Kill Number. Odds greater than four to one (4-1) are resolved at 4-1, and odds lower than one to four (1-4) are resolved at 1-4. 15.7 Resolution \u00b6 The assaulting player makes a dice roll and adds any applicable modifiers. Cover modifiers do not apply to close assaults. If the modified dice roll is equal to or less than the Kill Number the defending units are eliminated. 15.8 Taking Ground and Taking Casualties \u00b6 Outcome Assaulter CPs Defender CPs Assault succeeds Cover modifier + 1 CP per defending unit (eliminated) Assault fails Assault roll difference + Cover modifier + 1 CP per defending unit 1 CP per assaulting unit If the defending units are eliminated, the assaulting units immediately occupy the vacant hex (Exception: A full stack may assault a Bunker, but only two units may occupy the location; see 20.3 and 20.5 ), but suffer Casualty Points equal to the cover modifier of the hex assaulted (including any hexside terrain crossed, such as a wall or hedge), plus one Casualty Point for each defending unit (Exception: See 15.9 Assaulting Pinned Units , below). Casualty Points are applied in the same manner as described in 14.61 . If the assaulting unit(s) fail to eliminate the defending units (the dice roll was higher than the Kill Number), the assaulting unit(s) suffer a number of Casualty Points equal to the number by which the assault dice roll failed, plus the cover modifier of the hex assaulted, plus one for each defending unit. Defending units also suffer one Casualty Point for each assaulting unit, even though the assault failed. For example, if three squads conduct an assault into a woods hex (+2 cover modifier) against two squads, and the odds are 2-1, the assaulting player must roll an 8 or less to eliminate the enemy units, but the assaulting units would automatically suffer two Casualty Points for the cover modifier of the woods hex, and two more Casualty Points for the two defending squads. If the assaulting player rolls a 10 the assault fails, and two (10-8=2) Casualty Points are applied to the assaulting units for the failed attempt, plus two more for the woods hex, plus two for the defending squads for a total of six Casualty Points. The defending player would suffer three Casualty Points for the three assaulting squads. 15.81 Hill Assaults and Casualty Points \u00b6 Units assaulting into a hill hex from a lower elevation suffer +1 additional Casualty Point per uphill level traversed for the assault. 15.9 Assaulting Pinned Units \u00b6 Pinned units are automatically eliminated when close assaulted, and are immediately removed before the odds are calculated against any unpinned units remaining in the target hex. Pinned units have no effect on assaulting units (i.e. they do not contribute to casualties versus assaulting units). If a target hex contains only pinned units, the pinned units are eliminated and removed, and the assaulting units automatically take the target hex; no assault dice roll is necessary, and the assaulting units suffer no casualties as a result of the assault. 15.10 Failed Assaults Versus AFVs \u00b6 An AFV defending against a failed assault may be immobilized by the attack. Casualty Points from a failed assault are applied to the AFV, with the defending player making an immobilization die roll. If the roll is equal to or less than the Casualty Points inflicted the AFV is immobilized, and marked with an Immobile marker. If the roll is greater than the Casualty Points there is no effect. A maximum of three (3) Casualty Points may be applied in this manner (with three Casualty Points resulting in immobilization, no die roll necessary), with any additional Casualty Points applied to other units occupying the hex (if present). If the AFV is carrying passengers, the Casualty Points may be applied to the passengers as Collateral Damage (see 14.65 Collateral Damage to Passengers ). Passengers may not be pinned to fulfill Casualty Points; they may only be reduced or eliminated (for their full Casualty Rating). Any remaining Casualty Points, after eliminating passengers, must be applied to the AFV in the form of an immobilization roll. Close Assault Example \u00b6 A German platoon close assaults a group of Americans in a building hex. The German player has an APFP of 13, and decides to use a Grenade counter, which modifies his dice roll by -1. The American player has an APFP of 11. When the APFP totals are compared (13-11), the odds are 1-1. The Kill Number for 1-1 odds is 6 or less, modified to 5 or less by the American leader, Coleman. The German player rolls two dice for a result of 7, -1 for the leader, Schmidt, and -1 for the Grenades, for a total of 5. The American units are eliminated. The German units move into the building hex, but suffer six Casualty Points; three for the building hex, and three for the defending units. The German player eliminates one squad, and pins another to cover the six Casualty Points.","title":"15. Close Assaults"},{"location":"15_close_assaults/#15-close-assaults","text":"","title":"15.

Snipers \u00b6 17.1 General \u00b6 Snipers are provided per a scenario's OOB. A player will never have more than one sniper, per game, at his disposal. A sniper may only be brought into play when activated, and remains in play, in its original hex, until withdrawn or eliminated. Snipers may not be used as spotters for mortars or off-board artillery or air strikes. 17.2 Activating a Sniper \u00b6 A player's sniper is activated when an opposing infantry unit rolls a natural 12 (\u2685\u2685) while making an AP or AT attack. If activated, a Sniper marker is placed within LOS and six hexes of the attacking unit(s) that activated the sniper, and the sniper immediately attacks those units (see 17.5 Resolving a Sniper Attack ). The Sniper marker must be placed in a hex that provides a cover modifier, and hindrance hexes may be used (i.e. behind a hedge). If no cover hex is available the sniper may not be activated. 17.3 Withdrawing a Sniper \u00b6 A sniper may be voluntarily withdrawn by the owning player during any After-Action Phase. If a sniper is withdrawn it is removed from the board, and may only be activated again when a natural 12 is rolled by opposing infantry units making an AP or AT attack. 17.4 Opportunity Fire \u00b6 A sniper that remains on the board may make one Opportunity Fire attack per turn, during the opposing player's Movement Phase, against a moving infantry target. The sniper must have LOS to the target, and the target must be within six hexes. A Fire marker is placed on the sniper after it conducts an Opportunity Fire attack. 17.5 Resolving a Sniper Attack \u00b6 The sniper player makes a die roll, and if the roll exceeds the cover modifier of the target hex, including any intervening terrain hindrances, the target unit(s) suffer a number of Casualty Points equal to the result of the die roll minus the applicable cover modifier(s). Casualty Points are applied in the same manner as described in 14.61 . For example, a group of attacking units in a woods hex generate a sniper. The sniper player rolls a 5, thus inflicting 3 Casualty Points to the units that generated the sniper. 17.6 Eliminating a Sniper \u00b6 Whenever a sniper makes an attack the opposing player immediately makes a Sniper Elimination Check. Only the units targeted by the sniper may make an elimination check. If there are no unpinned units in the target hex an elimination check cannot be made. A die roll is made, and if the roll exceeds the cover modifier of the sniper's location, including any intervening terrain hindrances, the sniper is eliminated. If an enemy unit enters a sniper's hex it is automatically eliminated. A player may no longer activate a sniper if it is eliminated.","title":"17.

Anti-Tank (AT) Combat \u00b6 18.1 Anti-Tank (AT) Fire \u00b6 AT fire may target AFVs, vehicles or Guns. AT fire has no effect on infantry units. The firing unit must be able to make an AT attack (i.e. the unit must have an ATFP rating), or if the attacking unit is infantry it must be using a support weapon with an ATFP rating. AT fire affects a single target unit. Infantry being transported by an AFV or vehicle may not conduct AT attacks. 18.2 Range \u00b6 Infantry units using an AT support weapon may fire at a target within the range printed on the support weapon's counter. A Gun, including an AFVs Gun, may fire its ATFP rating at unlimited range, as long as it has LOS to the target. 18.3 Procedure \u00b6 The attacking player declares which unit is conducting the AT attack, and the target unit of the attack, checks the range to the target, then consults the Anti-Tank To-Hit Numbers chart to determine the initial, unmodified to-hit number. Once the to-hit number is determined the attacking player makes a to-hit dice roll, modified by cover if applicable. If the roll is equal to or less than the to-hit number, the attacking unit successfully hits the target. 18.4 Results \u00b6 Elimination roll Result < Elimination Number Eliminates AFV (removed) = Elimination Number Immobilizes AFV (marked) > Elimination Number No effect An unarmored vehicle or Gun hit by an AT attack is automatically eliminated. If an AFV is hit, the attacking player cross-references the attacking unit's ATFP rating with the target unit's Armor Factor on the Armor Elimination Chart to obtain an Elimination Number. A dice roll equal to the Elimination Number immobilizes the AFV, and it is marked with an Immobile marker. A dice roll less than the Elimination Number eliminates the AFV. Cover modifiers are not applied to the elimination roll. If the attacker rolls higher than the Elimination Number there is no effect. Eliminated units are removed from play. 18.5 Determining the Armor Factor \u00b6 Armor Facing Diagram The Armor Factor used to determine the Elimination Number depends on the facing of the target unit in relation to the firing unit. Consult the Armor Facing diagram to determine which Armor Factor is used. Facing is irrelevant if the unit only has one Armor Factor, and that Armor Factor is used to determine the Elimination Number. Die roll Result 1-3 Front armor 4-6 Rear armor If the attacking unit's LOS travels directly along the hexside between the Front and Rear armor of the target unit, the attacking player rolls a die. On a result of 1-3 the target unit's Front armor is used to resolve the attack, and on a result of 4-6 the unit's Rear armor is used. 18.6 Immobilization \u00b6 An immobilized AFV is marked with an Immobile marker, and the owning player immediately checks to see if the crew abandons the AFV. A die roll of 2 or less indicates the crew has abandoned the vehicle, and the unit is considered eliminated and removed from play. Whenever an immobilized AFV is attacked - by any type of attack - and the unit survives, the player must check to see if the crew abandons the AFV. An immobilized AFV may not move or change facing, but may still fire normally. 18.7 Smoke Rounds \u00b6 A Gun (or an AFV armed with a Gun) may fire a smoke round in lieu of a normal AT attack. The unit must have LOS to the target hex. The Gun automatically places a Smoke 2 marker in the target hex; no dice roll is necessary. The unit is marked with a Fire marker, and two smoke factors are deducted from the player's smoke supply. Anti-Tank Combat Example \u00b6 The M4A3E8 in hex E4 is firing on the Tiger I in hex C1 using its ATFP rating of D. The target unit is within 10 hexes, so the M4A3E8 needs to roll a 10 or less to hit. The woods in hex C1 modify the to-hit dice roll by +2. The player rolls his dice, and the result is a 7, +2 for the woods, for a total of 9 - the M4A3E8 hits the Tiger! The M4A3E8's ATFP rating of D is cross-referenced with the Tiger's rear Armor rating of D on the Armor Elimination Chart, yielding an Elimination Number of 7. The attacking player rolls a 6, less than the Elimination Number, destroying the Tiger!","title":"18.

Armor Overruns \u00b6 19.1 General \u00b6 Overruns are a special type of attack an AFV may conduct against infantry units, unarmored vehicles and Guns. AFVs may not be the target of an overrun attack. Only AFVs may conduct an overrun; unarmored vehicles may not make overrun attacks. Overruns are performed during the Movement Phase. Overrun attacks may not be made through a building hex, a hex containing a Bunker (see 20. Fortifications and Entrenchments ), a hex containing an enemy AFV, or through or into a hex the AFV is prohibited from entering normally. An AFV transporting (towing) a Gun may not make an overrun attack. 19.2 Opportunity Fire Versus an Overrunning AFV \u00b6 Any eligible unit, including units in the target hex, may conduct an Opportunity Fire attack against an overrunning AFV as it enters any hex except the target hex. As the AFV exits the target hex it may once again be targeted by Opportunity Fire. A surviving unit in the target hex, capable of making an AT attack, may conduct a Final Opportunity Fire attack versus the AFV's rear armor as it exits the target hex, even if the unit is already marked with a Fire marker. A leader may modify a Final Opportunity Fire attack, even if marked with a Fire marker. 19.3 Procedure \u00b6 The player executing the overrun attack moves the AFV through the target hex, and exits into the hex directly opposite the one it entered. The AFV must expend two Movement Points for the overrun attack, in addition to the cost of entering each hex during the entire overrun move, including moving into the exit hex. 19.4 Resolution \u00b6 Overrun attacks are resolved on the AP Combat Table, using double the AFVs full, combined APFP ratings. An AFV carrying infantry may add the infantry unit(s) APFP rating(s) to its total, including any Light ( L ) machine guns, grenades, and satchel charges the player wishes to use. Passenger APFP ratings are not doubled; only the AFVs APFP ratings are doubled. Cover modifiers apply to the attack dice roll. The AFV is marked with a Move marker after the overrun is concluded. The unit may not move further than the exit hex, nor may it change its facing, even if the unit has Movement Points remaining at the conclusion of the overrun. Armor Overrun Example \u00b6 The M4A3E8 is conducting an overrun against the German units in hex D2, a woods hex. The M4A3E8 has 10 Movement Points- enough to move it through the target hex and into the exit hex, D1. The total Movement Point cost will be seven; one for moving into D4, no cost for turning one hexside to face the target hex, one for D3, two for D2 (moving into woods), two for the overrun attack, and one for exiting into hex D1 (1+1+2+2+1=7). As the M4A3E8 enters hex D3 the German player decides to use a Panzerfaust to Opportunity Fire on the attacking tank. He needs an 8 or less to hit, and rolls a 7, -1 for Schmidt's leadership modifier, resulting in a final roll of 6-a hit versus the M4A3E8! Cross-indexing the Panzerfaust's AT rating of \"D\" with the M4A3E8's front armor of \"E\" on the Armor Elimination Table yields an Elimination Number of 5 or less. The German player rolls an 11, resulting in no effect. The attacking player moves the M4A3E8 into the occupied hex. The total APFP for the M4A3E8 is 19, doubled to 38 for the overrun. Resolving the overrun, the attacking player rolls a 2, modified by +2 for the woods and +1 for the foxholes, for a total of 5. A result of 5 on the 29-40 row of the AP Combat Table yields 6 Casualty Points. The German player decides to eliminate one squad to cover five Casualty Points, and pins the other squad to cover the final Casualty Point.

Counters and Markers \u00b6 1.1 Unit and Weapon Counters \u00b6 Counters are used to represent the combat units and weapons. Each counter represents one squad, one half squad, one leader (or hero), one support weapon, one armored fighting vehicle (AFV), one unarmored vehicle, or one artillery or anti-tank Gun. An infantry unit with an E in the upper right corner of the counter is an elite unit. 1.11 Squad \u00b6 The squad is the base infantry fighting unit in WWII. A squad counter has two soldiers depicted on it, and represents 8 to 12 men. 1.12 Half Squad \u00b6 A half squad counter has one soldier depicted on it, and represents 2 to 5 men. 1.13 Leader \u00b6 A leader counter represents a single man. A leader counter has one soldier depicted on it, and a leadership modifier in the upper left corner of the counter. A leader counter will sometimes be used to represent a hero, but only when indicated by a scenario. 1.14 Support Weapon \u00b6 There are three types of support weapons: Light ( L ), Heavy ( H ), and Expendable ( X ). A support weapon must be carried, and used, by an infantry unit (Exception: Expendable (X) support weapons are not placed with, or carried by, units). 1.15 Gun \u00b6 A Gun represents an artillery, anti-tank, or anti-aircraft gun. A Gun counter has the depiction of the weapon on it, and the side of the counter the weapon is facing is the front of the unit. A Gun has an inherent crew, and does not need an infantry counter to operate. Large Guns have \"0\" Movement Points, and may only be moved when towed by a transport unit. 1.16 AFV \u00b6 An AFV is a tank, self-propelled gun, halftrack, or armored car. An AFV counter has the depiction of the vehicle on it, and the side of the counter the vehicle is facing is the front of the unit. An AFV may be armed with a main Gun and multiple machine guns, as indicated on the counter. An AFV has an inherent crew, and does not need an infantry counter to operate. 1.17 Vehicle \u00b6 A vehicle is a jeep, truck, or other type of unarmored transport unit. A vehicle counter has the depiction of the unit on it, and the side of the counter the vehicle is facing is the front of the unit. A vehicle may be armed with machine guns, and in rare instances with a Gun. A vehicle has an inherent crew, and does not need an infantry counter to operate. 1.2 Unit and Weapon Stats \u00b6 A unit's stats are printed on its counter. If the counter has a dash (-) in place of a firepower rating or ability, or no rating or ability listed, it indicates the unit is not armed with that particular weapon, or possess that particular ability. 1.21 Anti-Personnel Firepower (APFP) \u00b6 A unit's Anti-Personnel Firepower may be used when it fires on infantry units, unarmored vehicles, and Guns. APFP has no effect on AFVs (Exception: Close Assaults ). A Gun's APFP is listed below its Anti-Tank Firepower. An AFV or vehicle may have up to two machine gun ratings. An AFV or vehicle machine gun APFP rating with a white circle beneath it is a 360\u00b0 machine gun (360\u00b0 MG), and may be fired in any direction. A machine gun without the white circle beneath it is a forward firing machine gun (FF MG), and may only be fired at targets in the unit's Forward Firing Arc (FFA, see 7.4 Forward Firing Arc ). 1.22 Anti-Tank Firepower (ATFP) \u00b6 A unit's Anti-Tank Firepower may be used when it fires on AFVs, vehicles and Guns. An AFV with a white circle beneath its ATFP is turreted, and may fire its Gun (using either AT or AP fire) in any direction. An AFV without the white circle beneath its ATFP may only fire its Gun in its FFA. 1.23 Range \u00b6 Range is the number of hexes the unit may fire using its APFP or ATFP ratings. A Gun has no range limit. All AFV and vehicle machine guns have a maximum range of eight hexes. Mortars are indirect fire weapons, and have a minimum range of two hexes (see 12.6 Mortars ). 1.24 Casualty Rating \u00b6 Infantry units, unarmored vehicles and Guns have a Casualty Rating. A unit's Casualty Rating is a measure of its survivability when fired on by APFP. 1.25 Armor Factor \u00b6 AFVs only. The Armor Factor is used when the unit is attacked by ATFP. If the AFV has two Armor Factors, the upper factor is for front armor, and the lower factor is for rear armor. If only a single Armor Factor is listed it is used for both front and rear armor. 1.26 Gun Shield \u00b6 Only Guns have a Gun Shield. A Gun Shield provides extra protection to the unit when attacked from within the unit's FFA. 1.27 Leadership Modifier \u00b6 Leaders only. A leader's leadership modifier may be used to modify certain dice rolls. 1.28 Movement Points \u00b6 AFVs and vehicles only. Movement Points determine how far a unit can move each turn. 1.29 Transport Class \u00b6 Transport vehicles only. The Transport Class indicates the number and type of units the transport unit may carry. 1.3 Game Markers \u00b6 Game markers are used to record game information during play. When a marker is used to indicate the status of a unit it is placed on top of the affected unit.","title":"1.

Fortifications and Entrenchments \u00b6 20.1 General \u00b6 Fortifications and entrenchments are improved defensive positions constructed to provide additional cover for defending units, or to hinder enemy movement (i.e. barbed wire or minefields). A scenario's OOB will indicate if fortifications or entrenchments are available, the number provided, and guidelines for placing them on the board(s). Fortifications and entrenchments remain in their hex even after the units occupying them have been eliminated, or have abandoned the position. Fortifications and entrenchments have no effect on LOS, unless otherwise indicated. 20.2 Placement \u00b6 Fortifications may only be placed in open terrain hexes, including open hill, road, beach and field hexes. Entrenchments may be placed in any hex except buildings, stream, gully or wadi, canal, pond or marsh hexes. 20.3 Movement and Occupying \u00b6 The cost to enter a fortification or entrenchment hex is +1 Movement Point (Exception: Minefield (see 20.7 Minefield ) and barbed wire (see 20.8 Barbed Wire ) do not cost an additional Movement Point to enter), in addition to the normal terrain cost to enter the hex; no additional Movement Points are needed to enter the defensive position. Fortification or entrenchment hexes may also be entered by advancing into the hex (and the emplacement) during the Advance and Assault Phase, or after conducting a successful close assault. When a unit occupies a fortification or entrenchment hex it is placed under the fortification or entrenchment counter. Enemy units may not move into or through an occupied fortification or entrenchment hex, unless conducting a close assault or armor overrun. An unoccupied fortification or entrenchment hex may be entered and/or occupied by either side, unless otherwise noted. A unit that enters a fortification or entrenchment hex must either continue moving or enter the defensive position, as long as doing so does not exceed the emplacement's stacking limit. A unit may never occupy a fortification or entrenchment hex and remain outside the defensive position. 20.4 Stacking Limits \u00b6 Only the fortification or entrenchment, and the unit(s) occupying the position, are allowed in a hex. Friendly units may move freely through a hex containing an occupied fortification or entrenchment, but they may not stop in the hex and remain outside the fortification or entrenchment. If the defensive position is already at its full, stacking limit capacity, the unit must continue moving, or it may not enter the hex if it would be unable to exit. 20.5 Bunker \u00b6 A bunker is a fortification. A bunker may be occupied by one Gun, or two infantry units (of any type) and their support weapons. A concrete reinforced bunker provides a +4 cover modifier, and a wood reinforced earthen bunker provides a +3 cover modifier. An attacking unit cannot target a unit in a bunker with ATFP; it must use APFP when firing on a bunker. Units in the bunker may only fire out of the bunker's FFA, indicated by the white triangle at the top of the fortification's counter. Mortars may not fire out of a bunker, even if the firing unit has LOS to the target hex. A bunker blocks LOS. 20.6 Sandbags \u00b6 Sandbags are a fortification. Infantry and Gun units may occupy sandbags, and normal stacking limits apply. A sandbag position provides a +2 cover modifier. 20.7 Minefield \u00b6 A minefield is a fortification. A minefield attacks a unit as soon as it enters the minefield hex. A minefield only attacks when a unit enters the minefield hex; it may remain in, or leave the minefield hex, with no further detriment. A die roll is made for each unit affected by the minefield, with a roll of 3 or less resulting in the unit's elimination. 20.71 Hidden Minefield \u00b6 Hidden minefields are provided only by special scenario rule. When a minefield is hidden the owning player secretly records the map and hex location of the Minefield marker. When a unit enters a hidden minefield hex the owning player reveals the minefield, places a Minefield marker in the hex, and resolves the minefield attack normally. 20.8 Barbed Wire \u00b6 Barbed wire is a fortification. An infantry unit that enters a barbed wire hex must stop. The unit may advance out of the barbed wire in the subsequent Advance and Assault Phase, or continue moving normally during the owning player's next Movement Phase. Infantry units firing from a barbed wire hex suffer a +1 die roll penalty to their attack. Vehicles may not enter a barbed wire hex. AFVs are unaffected by barbed wire. During the Fire Phase, in lieu of an attack, a unit may place a satchel charge (if available) in an adjacent barbed wire hex, automatically removing the obstacle. The unit placing the charge is marked with a Fire marker. 20.9 Foxholes \u00b6 Foxholes are an entrenchment, and may only be occupied by infantry units. Normal stacking limits apply to a foxhole hex. A foxhole provides a +1 cover modifier to the hex it occupies, in addition to the terrain in the hex. 20.10 Trenches \u00b6 Trenches are an entrenchment, and may only be occupied by infantry units. Normal stacking limits apply to a trench hex. Trenches provide a +2 cover modifier, in addition to the terrain in the hex. 20.11 Caves \u00b6 Caves are an entrenchment. Caves only appear in Pacific Theater scenarios, and only the Japanese player may use caves. The scenario's OOB will indicate the number of Cave markers the Japanese player receives. A Cave marker identifies the entrance to an underground tunnel complex, and each Cave marker must be placed within four hexes of another Cave marker. Infantry units and Guns may occupy the cave entrance, and normal stacking limits apply. A cave provides a +2 cover modifier to the hex it occupies, in addition to the terrain in the hex. 20.12 Tunnel Complexes \u00b6 Tunnel complexes usually only appear around large, fortified strongpoints, and are more prevalent in Pacific Theater scenarios. Only infantry units may enter a tunnel complex, and they may only do so through a bunker attached to the tunnel complex, or through a cave entrance (i.e. the Cave marker). A bunker may be placed along a tunnel route, and a unit may enter the bunker from within the tunnel, as well as from above ground. When a unit enters a tunnel it is removed from the map board and placed on the tunnel complex diagram. Units move through the tunnels per normal movement rates, one Movement Point per hex. Units in a tunnel may not be seen or attacked. 20.121 Tunnel Complex Diagram Some scenarios may provide the description or diagram for a tunnel complex, while others may allow the owning player to design their own layout. If the scenarios allows the owning player to design their own complex, the player may use a copy of the scenario's map board, or a blank hex sheet, and draw the layout of the tunnel system. Any section of the tunnel may be no longer than four hexes, and must have a bunker or cave entrance at each endpoint of the tunnel complex. A cave entrance may have any number of tunnels branching from it, but each tunnel must lead to another entrance. Tunnels may never travel under a water feature (i.e. stream, pond, marsh, beach, ocean or river hex). Separate tunnel systems may intersect each other, as long as each follows the rules outline above.","title":"20.

Artillery and Air Support \u00b6 21.1 General \u00b6 Artillery and air support represents off-board artillery batteries (including naval guns) and fighter-bombers that provide fire support missions for on-board units. Artillery and air support are provided by a scenario's OOB. 21.2 Availability \u00b6 The scenario will indicate the type of support available to each player, and the number of fire missions each type of support will provide. When a scenario indicates a player receives support, he places a number of Light Barrage, Heavy Barrage, or Fighter-Bomber markers for each support mission, as denoted in the OOB section of the scenario, on the table in front of him. 21.3 Spotter \u00b6 An unpinned, friendly unit must act as a spotter for an artillery support mission, and must have LOS to the target hex. Any number of available artillery support missions may be used each turn, but the player must have a friendly, unpinned unit with LOS to each target hex. A spotter is not necessary for fighter-bombers; the fighter-bomber has LOS to all hexes on the board. 21.4 Using Support Missions \u00b6 Die roll Effect \u2264 4 Hit 5 1 hex scatter 6 2 hex scatter When a player uses a support mission he places the appropriate marker in the target hex during the Command Phase. All support missions a player wishes to use are placed before resolution. A die roll is made for each artillery support mission, and if the roll is 4 or less the support mission hits the target hex. If the die roll is a 5 the support mission scatters one hex from the original target hex, and if the die roll is a 6 the support mission scatters two hexes from the original target hex. The player rolls a die and consults the Artillery Scatter diagram to determine which direction the support mission scatters, and moves the support mission's marker one or two hexes (depending on the original die roll) in that direction. Any mission which scatters off the board has no effect, but still counts as having been used. No resolution roll is necessary if the artillery mission scatters off the board, or if there are no units in the target hex. The attack is resolved if there are any units in the target hex, including friendly units. 21.5 Resolution \u00b6 Each support mission must be resolved separately. A support mission affects all units in the target hex. Terrain modifiers in the target hex apply to the support mission's attack dice roll. Hexside hindrances around the target hex, such as walls or hedges, do not affect the support mission's dice roll. If a hex contains infantry, vehicle, or Gun units, a dice roll is made and cross referenced with the support mission's APFP on the AP Combat Table to obtain a Casualty Point number, which is then applied normally to all eligible targets. If an AFV is located in the hex the support mission must first roll to-hit on an 8 or less , applying cover modifiers to the to-hit dice roll. If an AFV is hit, the support mission's strength is cross-referenced with the AFV's rear armor rating on the Armor Elimination Chart to obtain an Elimination Number. A dice roll equal to or less than the Elimination Number eliminates the unit. 21.6 Air Bursts Versus Infantry \u00b6 Casualty Points from an artillery strike applied to infantry units in woods and jungle hexes are doubled . 21.7 Smoke Barrage \u00b6 A player may use an off-board artillery mission to place smoke, in lieu of attacking a hex. Fighter-bombers may not be used to place smoke. Using off-board artillery to place smoke does not expend a support mission marker, but the player must have an available artillery marker (either Light or Heavy) to place smoke. If a player has no artillery markers available he may not place smoke with off-board artillery. As with a regular support mission, the player must check to see if the smoke lands in the target hex, and if not he must determine where the smoke round lands using the Artillery Scatter diagram and procedure outlined in section 21.4 . A Smoke 2 marker is placed in the final target hex, and the player deducts two smoke factors from his smoke supply. 21.8 Single Use \u00b6 Each support mission may only be used once, and when used the support mission's marker is removed from play.","title":"21.

Sequence of Play \u00b6 5.1 Game Turns \u00b6 Games are played in a series of turns. Each turn is divided into two Player Segments and an End of Turn Segment. Each Player Segment is further divided into a number of Phases. A turn ends after the End of Turn Segment, and a new turn begins unless the previous turn was the last turn of the game (per the scenario). Summary Player A Segment Command Phase Fire Phase Movement Phase Defensive Fire Phase Advance and Assault Phase After-Action Phase Player B Segment End of Turn Segment 5.2 Initiative \u00b6 The scenario will indicate which player starts the game, assuming the role of Player A for the remainder of the game. 5.3 Player A Segment \u00b6 Player A takes his turn, following the Phase sequence outlined below. 5.31 Command Phase \u00b6 Player A automatically rallies all of his pinned units, flipping them to their face-up, unpinned side. Player A places all Artillery Barrage and Fighter-Bomber missions he is using this turn in their target hexes, then resolves those attacks accordingly. Player A may have infantry units which are located in the same hex exchange or transfer support weapons. Player A may split any of his squads into two half squads of the same type, or combine two half squads into a squad, if the units are located in the same hex with a leader. 5.32 Fire Phase \u00b6 Player A may fire with any of his units. Player A may opt to fire smoke, in lieu of an attack, with any of his eligible AFV, Gun or mortar units. Units that fire are marked with a Fire marker. 5.33 Movement Phase \u00b6 Player A may move any of his units that are not marked with a Fire marker. Units that move are marked with a Move marker after their move. Infantry units may place Smoke (see 11. Smoke ) before starting their move. Player A declares if any moving infantry units are conducting an Assault Move (see 6.4 Infantry Assault Movement ), and marks them with an Assault Move marker. Assault Move markers are removed when a unit concludes its move, and replaced with a Move marker. Player A declares and resolves any Armor Overrun attacks (see 19. Armor Overruns ). Player B may Opportunity Fire (see 13.8 Opportunity Fire ) at any of Player A's units that are moving within range and Line of Sight (LOS) of any of his units. Units that Opportunity Fire are marked with a Fire marker. Infantry units with an MG that Opportunity Fire may establish a Fire Lane (see 13.9 MG Fire Lanes ). Fire Lane markers are removed from the board once all movement and opportunity fire attacks have concluded. 5.34 Defensive Fire Phase \u00b6 Player B may fire with any of his units not marked with a Fire marker. Units that fire are marked with a Fire marker. 5.35 Advance and Assault Phase \u00b6 Player A may advance his units (any type of unit) one hex, regardless of terrain cost (unless the unit is prohibited from entering the hex), even if marked with a Move or Fire marker. Infantry units not advancing may conduct a close assault versus an adjacent, enemy occupied hex, even if marked with a Move or Fire marker. 5.36 After-Action Phase \u00b6 Player A may attempt to Rally any of his pinned units (see 14.8 After-Action Phase Rally Attempt ). Both players remove all Move and Fire markers from their units. Smoke 1 markers dissipate and are removed from the board, and Smoke 2 markers are replaced with Smoke 1 markers. Any active snipers (see 17. Snipers ) may be withdrawn from the board. 5.4 Player B Segment \u00b6 The Player Segment is repeated, in the order above, by Player B. 5.5 End of Turn Segment \u00b6 The Turn marker is advanced to the next turn on the scenario card, unless the previous turn was the last turn of the scenario.","title":"5.

Movement \u00b6 6.1 General \u00b6 Units are moved one hex at a time, expending Movement Points as they enter each hex until the player wishes to stop, or the unit has exhausted its Movement Points. Units may be moved individually, or they may be moved together, up to their normal stacking limits (see 6.9 Stacking Limits ). Units that move as a stack must start and end their moves together. If units of different types are moved together the player must pay careful attention to terrain cost, terrain restrictions, and Movement Points expended by all units. Each unit, or stack of units, must conclude its move before another begins moving. 6.2 Terrain Effects on Movement \u00b6 Some hexes, according to the terrain in the hex, will adjust the number of Movement Points a unit must expend to enter the hex. A unit crossing a hexside terrain feature (such as a wall or hedge) must pay the movement cost of the hexside feature in addition to the terrain cost to enter the hex. 6.3 Movement Rate \u00b6 Movement rates vary, depending on the unit. 6.31 Infantry Movement Rates \u00b6 Type Movement points Leader 6 Squad 4 (with a leader: 6) Half squad 4 (with a leader: 6) Leaders have six (6) Movement Points. Squads and half squads have four (4) Movement Points. A squad or half squad that conducts its full move with a leader increases its Movement Points to six (6) . If the leader is pinned or eliminated during movement (see 13.8 Opportunity Fire ), any unit moving with the leader loses the leadership movement bonus. If the unit(s) moving with the leader have moved beyond their normal movement allowance they must stop in their current hex; otherwise, they may continue moving, using their normal movement allowance. 6.32 Vehicle, AFV, and Gun Movement Rates \u00b6 Vehicle and AFV movement rates vary, and are indicated on the unit's counter. Guns with one Movement Point may be moved one hex per turn, regardless of terrain, as long as the Gun is not prohibited from entering the hex. When a Gun is moved it may change its facing to any hexside as part of its move (see 7 Unit Facing ). 6.4 Infantry Assault Movement \u00b6 Infantry units may use a special form of assault movement. Infantry units using assault movement halve their Movement Points. The reduction in Movement Points is applied before the unit moves, or before any other reductions are applied to the unit's Movement Points. When an infantry unit uses assault movement it is marked with an Assault Move marker and gains a +1 cover modifier, in addition to the cover modifier of the terrain it occupies. The Assault Move marker is removed after the unit concludes its move, and the unit is marked with a Move marker. 6.5 Vehicles and Turning \u00b6 When a vehicle moves it may make one turn, up to three hexsides, per hex it enters. The first hexside change is free, and each hexside change after that costs one Movement Point. For example, a vehicle that moves into the hex it is facing may turn one hexside for free, two hexsides at a cost of one Movement Point, or three hexsides at a cost of two Movement Points. 6.6 Minimum Move \u00b6 A unit may always move one hex, regardless of terrain cost, as long as the unit is capable of moving and is not prohibited from entering the hex. 6.7 Friendly Hexes \u00b6 Units may move through hexes containing friendly units, fortifications, and emplacements, but may not end their move in the hex if their presence would exceed the stacking limit. 6.8 Enemy Hexes \u00b6 Units may not enter hexes occupied by enemy units unless they are conducting a Close Assault (see 15. Close Assaults ) or Armor Overrun (see 19. Armor Overruns ). 6.9 Stacking Limits \u00b6 Stacking limits 4 infantry units (any type) 2 AFVs, vehicles or Guns 1 AFV/vehicle/Gun + 2 infantry units A player may stack multiple, friendly units in the same hex, following these limitations: (1) two AFVs, vehicles or Guns, (2) four infantry units (of any type), or (3) one AFV, vehicle or Gun and two infantry units. An infantry unit or Gun sharing the same hex with an AFV or vehicle is placed under the AFV or vehicle's counter. An infantry unit or Gun being transported is placed on top of the transport unit's counter. Only the transport vehicle counts against the stacking limit. 6.10 Entering and Exiting the Map \u00b6 When a unit enters play, the map edge hex (or half hex) on which it enters counts as the first hex of movement.

Transport Units \u00b6 8.1 General \u00b6 A vehicle or AFV classified as a transport unit may carry infantry units and tow a Gun. A unit being transported is placed on top of the carrier unit, and is considered a single unit with the transporting unit. 8.2 Transport Class \u00b6 Each transport unit has a Transport Class, indicated by a letter and number combination ( T# ) on the unit's counter above its Movement Points. The Transport Class indicates the types and number of units a transport may carry. 8.21 Transport Limits \u00b6 A transport unit may carry one squad (or two half squads), one leader, and one support weapon per number in the Transport Class rating. For instance, if a transport is a T2, it may carry two squads (or the half squad equivalents), two leaders, and two support weapons. If the Transport Class is listed as \"TH\" the unit may only carry a half squad, a leader, and a support weapon. In addition to carrying passengers, a transport unit may also tow a Gun if the unit has a dash below its Transport Class. TH class units may not tow a large Gun (i.e. a Gun with \"0\" Movement Points). 8.3 Loading and Unloading \u00b6 An infantry unit or Gun may load onto, or unload from, a transport vehicle occupying the same hex during the Movement Phase. A unit (both passenger and transport units) may not load and unload in the same turn; each unit may only conduct one load or unload action per turn. A passenger unit may not move before loading, or after unloading, except to avoid over-stacking a hex. An infantry unit or Gun must move one hex after unloading if its presence would exceed stacking limits. The transport vehicle may move before or after loading or unloading, but not both before and after loading or unloading. When a unit unloads from a transport vehicle, whether it moves or not, it is marked with a Move marker. 8.4 Stacking \u00b6 A vehicle transporting a unit is considered one vehicle for stacking purposes. A vehicle may move into a hex in excess of stacking limits to load (only), but after loading the hex may not be in violation of stacking limits. 8.5 Combat \u00b6 Transport units may fire normally when carrying other units.

Line of Sight (LOS) \u00b6 9.1 General \u00b6 The LOS between units is a straight line, traced from the center dot of the firing unit's hex to the center dot of the target unit's hex. LOS works both ways; if a friendly unit has LOS to an enemy unit, the enemy unit has LOS back to the friendly unit. If the LOS is blocked the unit cannot see, nor fire on, the target unit. 9.2 Blocking Terrain \u00b6 A hex, depending on the terrain or terrain features in the hex, may block LOS. If the LOS passes through any portion of a blocking terrain hex the LOS is blocked. A unit cannot see, or attack, a unit if the LOS is blocked. A unit may see and fire into a blocking terrain hex, but not through the hex. Units in a blocking terrain hex may fire out of the hex normally. 9.3 Hindrances \u00b6 A terrain feature classified as a hindrance does not block LOS, but may modify movement and combat, and the effects are cumulative. 9.4 Hexside LOS \u00b6 Hexside LOS refers to any LOS traced along the full length of a hexside between two hexes, or a series of hexsides between their adjoining hexes, and not simply across a hexside into an adjacent hex. If a hex on both sides of the hexside LOS path contains blocking terrain, even if the hexes containing blocking terrain are not adjacent, the LOS is blocked . If a hex on the hexside LOS path contains blocking terrain or a hindrance (orchard, hay stack, or palm grove hex), and a hex on the other side of the LOS path contains a hindrance, the LOS is hindered , and a +1 hindrance modifier is applied to any attack dice roll crossing the hexside. If a hex along the hexside LOS path contains blocking terrain or a hindrance, and all hexes on the other side of the path are open, the LOS is neither blocked nor hindered. LOS that travels along a hexside featuring hexside terrain is either hindered (hedge or wall) or blocked (hedgerow). Once it is established that hexside LOS is hindered, each additional hindrance hex (or hexside hindrance) along the hexside LOS, on either side or through full hexes in which the LOS passes, adds +1 to the cumulative total. Line of Sight (LOS) and Cover Modifier Examples \u00b6 Unit A . Unit A has LOS to units 1 and 2 (and vice versa). Since unit A is adjacent to the hedge surrounding hex A1, the hedge is not a hindrance to attacks that unit A conducts; it may fire over the hedge with no detriment. Fire coming into the hex, however, from units 1 or 2, will suffer a +1 hindrance modifier for the hedge. An attack from unit A on unit 1 would suffer a +2 modifier for the woods hex it occupies, and an attack on unit 2 would suffer a +3 modifier for the building hex it occupies. Unit B . Unit B has LOS to units 1, 3 and 4. Since there is only one Level 1 hill hex between unit B and unit 4, the attack is considered up (or down) a continuous hill slope. If there were a second Level 1 hill hex between them LOS would be blocked. An attack on unit 1 would suffer a +2 modifier for the woods hex it occupies, but attacks on units 3 and 4 would not be modified as there's no cover terrain in the hill hexes. Likewise, unit B is in the open, and any attack from units 1, 3 or 4 would not be modified. Unit C . Unit C has LOS to units 2 and 4. Again, since there's only one Level 1 hill hex between unit C and unit 4, the attack is considered up (or down) a continuous slope. LOS to unit 2 passes through two hindrance hexes (Orchard) before reaching the target hex, incurring a modifier of +1 for each hex, and the building hex occupied by the target provides an additional +3 cover modifier, for a total cover modifier of +5. Unit 4, however, is in open terrain, providing a more inviting target. Unit C is also in open terrain, receiving no cover modifier if attacked by unit 4, but an attack from unit 2 would suffer a +2 modifier for the two Orchard (hindrance) hexes. Unit D . Unit D has LOS to units 3 and 4. LOS to unit 3 is not blocked because, even though there's a Level 1 hill hex between them, they are on the same elevation, and the hexside LOS crosses only has blocking terrain (the Level 2 hill hex) on one side. None of the units receive any cover modifiers in this example; they are all in open terrain. Hexside LOS Examples \u00b6 In the following examples, the players are checking for LOS between unit A and unit 1, which runs along the hexside between hexes B1 and B2. (LOS from unit A to unit 2 in the first illustration travels across a hexside to the adjacent hex.) In the illustration above, LOS between unit A and unit 1 is blocked because hexes B1 and B2 both contain blocking terrain (i.e. both hexes are building hexes). Note The two hexes affecting LOS need not be adjacent, as shown in these examples. The two offending hexes may lie at any point along the LOS path, as long as one falls on each side. In the illustration above, unit A and unit 1 have LOS to each other because hex B1 does not contain blocking terrain. It does, however, contain an orchard, which is a hindrance . A +1 hindrance modifier would be applied to any attack between unit A and unit 1. In the illustration above, unit A and unit 1 have LOS to each other, but a +2 hindrance modifier would be applied to any attack between the units. The first modifier is applied for the orchard in hex B1 (as stated in the previous example), and the second because LOS runs along a hedge covering the hexside between hexes B1 and B2 (see 10.10 Walls and Hedges ). If the hexside were designated a hedgerow LOS would be blocked.","title":"9. Line of Sight (LOS)"},{"location":"9_line_of_sight/#9-line-of-sight-los","text":"","title":"9.

If the LOS passes through any portion of a blocking terrain hex the LOS is blocked. A unit cannot see, or attack, a unit if the LOS is blocked.

If a hex on both sides of the hexside LOS path contains blocking terrain, even if the hexes containing blocking terrain are not adjacent, the LOS is blocked . If a hex on the hexside LOS path contains blocking terrain or a hindrance (orchard, hay stack, or palm grove hex), and a hex on the other side of the LOS path contains a hindrance, the LOS is hindered , and a +1 hindrance modifier is applied to any attack dice roll crossing the hexside. If a hex along the hexside LOS path contains blocking terrain or a hindrance, and all hexes on the other side of the path are open, the LOS is neither blocked nor hindered. LOS that travels along a hexside featuring hexside terrain is either hindered (hedge or wall) or blocked (hedgerow). Once it is established that hexside LOS is hindered, each additional hindrance hex (or hexside hindrance) along the hexside LOS, on either side or through full hexes in which the LOS passes, adds +1 to the cumulative total.","title":"9.4 Hexside LOS"},{"location":"9_line_of_sight/#line-of-sight-los-and-cover-modifier-examples","text":"Unit A . Unit A has LOS to units 1 and 2 (and vice versa). Since unit A is adjacent to the hedge surrounding hex A1, the hedge is not a hindrance to attacks that unit A conducts; it may fire over the hedge with no detriment. Fire coming into the hex, however, from units 1 or 2, will suffer a +1 hindrance modifier for the hedge. An attack from unit A on unit 1 would suffer a +2 modifier for the woods hex it occupies, and an attack on unit 2 would suffer a +3 modifier for the building hex it occupies. Unit B . Unit B has LOS to units 1, 3 and 4. Since there is only one Level 1 hill hex between unit B and unit 4, the attack is considered up (or down) a continuous hill slope. If there were a second Level 1 hill hex between them LOS would be blocked. An attack on unit 1 would suffer a +2 modifier for the woods hex it occupies, but attacks on units 3 and 4 would not be modified as there's no cover terrain in the hill hexes. Likewise, unit B is in the open, and any attack from units 1, 3 or 4 would not be modified. Unit C . Unit C has LOS to units 2 and 4. Again, since there's only one Level 1 hill hex between unit C and unit 4, the attack is considered up (or down) a continuous slope. LOS to unit 2 passes through two hindrance hexes (Orchard) before reaching the target hex, incurring a modifier of +1 for each hex, and the building hex occupied by the target provides an additional +3 cover modifier, for a total cover modifier of +5. Unit 4, however, is in open terrain, providing a more inviting target. Unit C is also in open terrain, receiving no cover modifier if attacked by unit 4, but an attack from unit 2 would suffer a +2 modifier for the two Orchard (hindrance) hexes. Unit D . Unit D has LOS to units 3 and 4. LOS to unit 3 is not blocked because, even though there's a Level 1 hill hex between them, they are on the same elevation, and the hexside LOS crosses only has blocking terrain (the Level 2 hill hex) on one side. None of the units receive any cover modifiers in this example; they are all in open terrain.","title":"Line of Sight (LOS) and Cover Modifier Examples"},{"location":"9_line_of_sight/#hexside-los-examples","text":"In the following examples, the players are checking for LOS between unit A and unit 1, which runs along the hexside between hexes B1 and B2.
